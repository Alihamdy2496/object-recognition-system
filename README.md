## Project: Object Recognition System

#### Objective:
Create a simple object recognition system that uses a camera to capture images and then uses computer vision techniques to identify objects in the images.

## Requirements:

1- The system should be able to capture images from a camera at regular intervals.

2- The system should be able to process the images to identify objects.

3- The system should be designed using the SOLID design principles to make it flexible and easy to maintain.

4- The system should be able to use different object recognition algorithms interchangeably.

## Tools and Libraries:

1- Python programming language

2- OpenCV library for computer vision

3- Webcam or Raspberry Pi camera module

## Implementation Details:

1- Set up a camera to capture images at regular intervals. This could involve writing code to interface with a webcam or a Raspberry Pi camera module.
Process the images to identify objects using computer vision techniques such as edge detection, feature extraction, and object classification. You could use the OpenCV library for Python to help with these tasks.

2- Design the classes and their interactions in a modular and flexible way using the SOLID design principles. For example, you could have a Camera class that is responsible for capturing images, an ImageProcessor class that is responsible for processing the images, and an ObjectRecognizer class that is responsible for identifying objects in the images.

3- Implement an interface for the ObjectRecognizer class that defines the methods for recognizing objects. This would allow you to use different object recognition algorithms interchangeably by creating new classes that implement the same interface.

4- Use the Dependency Inversion Principle to decouple the high-level ObjectRecognizer class from the low-level object recognition algorithm classes by introducing an abstraction between them.
